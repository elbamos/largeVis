#' @title as.dendrogram.hdbscan
#' @description Convert an hdbscan object into a dendrogram compatible with the \code{stats} package.
#' @note The hdbscan algorithm works by first building a hierarchy based on a minimal spanning tree, then consolidating nodes according to
#' rules in the algorithm. The algorithm then selects some of the consolidated nodes as clusters, deselecting others. For example, if Node A has children
#' B and C, the algorithm might select A, and then all points under A, B, and C would be assigned to the same cluster. Or, it might deselect A,
#' and select B and C instead. In that case, the nodes under B would be assigned to one cluster, the nodes under C to a different cluster, and nodes
#' under A but not B or C would not be assigned to any cluster. This function returns a dendrogram of the middle stage, the hierarchy of consolidated
#' nodes. Whether a node was selected as as cluster is an attribute of each node.
#' @param object An \code{hdbscan} object.
#' @param includeNodes Whether individual nodes should be included in the dedrogram. Can cause a substantial increase in the size of the object.
#' @param ... For compatibility with \code{as.dendrogram}, and currently ignored.
#' @return A \code{dendrogram} object, where nodes have the following attributes:
#' \describe{
#' \item{'leaf'}{As in \code{\link[stats]{dendrogram}}.}
#' \item{'members'}{As in \code{\link[stats]{dendrogram}}.}
#' \item{'size'}{The number of nodes underneath the cluster.}
#' \item{'height'}{The core distance at which the cluster or node was merged.}
#' \item{'probability'}{The probability that the leaf is a true member of its assigned cluster.}
#' \item{'GLOSH'}{The leaf's GLOSH outlier score.}
#' \item{'stability'}{The node's determined stability, taking into account child-node stabilities. Missing for leaves.}
#' \item{'selected'}{Whether the node was selected as a cluster.  Missing for leaves.  Note that when a node is selected,
#' all points under child branches are assigned to the same cluster.}
#' \item{'cluster'}{The cluster number, for reference against the \code{hdbscan} object.}
#' }
#'
#' @note This function remains experimental in terms of finding the best way to represent an hdbscan object in a dendrogram.
