## Overview

Besides manifold visualization, `largeVis` also includes an extremely efficient approximate nearest-neighbor search that runs in $O(n)$ time. 

This vignette includes benchmarks and recommendations for adjusting hyperparameters in the neighbor search for best results. 

## Hyperparameters

The `randomProjectionTreeSearch` function has two hyperparameters that trade-off accuracy and efficiency in the neighbor search:

1.  `n_trees` - In the first phase of the function, the number of random projection trees to create.
2.  `max_iters` - The number of iterations for the neighborhood-exploration phase of the algorithm.

## Data Collection \& Methodology

The data in the benchmarks below was obtained by running the `benchmark.R` script, which is installed along with the package, on two machines.  

The aim was to replicate as much as possible the methodology used by Erik Bernhardsson's [ANN Benchmark](https://github.com/erikbern/ann-benchmarks) github.  However, `ANN Benchmark` is designed for libraries that are designed to build a neighbor index and then rapidly process queries against the index. The measure used by `ANN Benchmark` is therefore queries-per-second.  By contract, `largeVis` is concerned with getting neighbors for all of the nodes in a finite dataset as quickly as possible. 

Times shown for `RcppAnnoy` include the time to build a searchable index and query neighbors for all rows in the dataset.

The data used is the 1-million vector, 128-feature [SIFT Dataset](http://corpus-texmex.irisa.fr/), which is the test data used by `ANN Benchmark`. 

The current set of benchmarks were run on my Macbook Air M1. You can run the `benchmark.R` script to generate your own.

I welcome submissions of output from the script from other hardware. 

## Comparison With Annoy

The following chart illustrates performance versus the `Annoy` library, as implemented through the `RcppAnnoy` R package.

To facilitate comparison with the ANN Benchmark charts, the Y-axis shows the number of vectors processed per second. 

```{r plotpeformance,echo=F,fig.align='center',warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
load(system.file("extdata", "benchmark.Rda", package = "largeVis"))
benchmark %>% 
  filter(machine != 'Large Server',
         machine == 'Workstation' | K == 50) %>%
  mutate(facet = precision, 
         facet = ifelse(facet < 0.95, '', 'Closeup'), 
         facet = factor(facet)) %>%
  ggplot(aes( y = time, 
              x = precision, 
              group = series, 
              fill = series, 
              shape = series)) +
  geom_point(size = 1.5, alpha = 0.7, color = "grey80") + 
  scale_y_log10(name = "Speed, log (nodes / seconds)") + 
  scale_x_continuous("Precision", 
                breaks = c(0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.925, 0.95, 0.975, 1.0)) +
  facet_grid(K + machine ~ facet, scales = "free") +
  scale_fill_manual(name = "Method & n. iter.", 
    values = colors_divergent_discrete(nlevels(benchmark$series))(nlevels(benchmark$series))) +
  scale_shape_manual(name = "Method & n. iter.", 
                     values = c(21, 21, 21, 21, 23)) +
 # guides(color = guide_legend(nrow=3)) +
  ggtitle(expression(
    atop("Precision-Performance tradeoff, RcppAnnoy and largeVis",
         atop(italic("(n = 10000; Upper Right is Better)"))
         )
    ))
```



## Effect of Increasing `tth` vs. `max_iters`


```{r tree_threshold,echo=F}
bench <- benchmark %>%
  filter(method == 'largeVis',
         machine != 'Large Server') %>%
  mutate(label = ifelse(threshold == 128, "128", "Other"), 
         label = factor(label), 
         facet = precision, 
         facet = ifelse(facet < 0.85, '', 'Closeup'))
bench$facet <- factor(bench$facet)
bench %>% 
  arrange(nn) %>%
  mutate(max_iters = factor(max_iters)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = time, 
             x = precision , 
             color = max_iters, 
             group = max_iters)) + 
  geom_point(size = 0.2, alpha =0.8) +
  geom_line(size = 0.2, alpha = 0.8) +
  facet_grid(K + machine ~ facet, scales = 'free') +
  scale_y_log10(name = "Speed, log (nodes / second)") + 
  scale_x_continuous("Precision", 
                breaks = c(0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9, 0.92, 0.94, 0.96, 0.98, 1.0)) +
 # scale_shape_discrete(name = "", solid = FALSE) + 
 #   guides(color = FALSE) +
   scale_color_manual("n. iter", values = colors_discrete(4)) +    
  ggtitle(expression(
    atop("Precision-Performance tradeoff, effect of increasing tth vs. max_iters",
         atop(italic("(n = 10000; Upper Right is Better)")))))
```

Each line shows the precision-performance tradeoff that can be obtained by varying the number of trees and threshold while holding the number of iterations constant. As the chart shows, neighborhood exploration iterations move the precision-performance frontier outward. The marginal benefit of additional iterations declines as iterations are added.  

This is consistent with the conclusions of the original paper authors.
